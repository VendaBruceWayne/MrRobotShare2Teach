                <p>
                    Share2Teach is an innovative platform designed to transform the way
                    educators and learners access and share educational resources. Developed by a team 
                    of four passionate Information Technology students currently in their third year, 
                    Share2Teach is a product of creativity, collaboration, and a shared vision for 
                    enhancing education.
                </p>
                <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Share2Teach was born out of a project assigned to our development team during our 
                    third year of study. As aspiring developers, we were tasked with creating a platform
                    that could make a real impact in the educational field. We envisioned a space where 
                    educators and learners could freely share, access, and collaborate on a variety of resources, 
                    making quality education accessible to all.
                </p>
                <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Our Team</h2>
                <p>
                    Our team of four developers worked together on every aspect of Share2Teach, 
                    combining our skills and knowledge to build a cohesive and functional platform. 
                    Each of us contributed to the frontend, backend, database management, 
                    and overall project coordination, ensuring that every feature and functionality
                    was developed through a unified effort. This approach allowed us to learn from one another
                    and refine our skills as we tackled challenges together.
